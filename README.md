# ReDI-DS-2021-final-project
This is my final project on ReDI data science course spring 2021.

My project is about asteroid's orbit classification of near earth asteroids.

The data used is from kaggle.com:

## Orbit Classification For Prediction / NASA
The data used for the project can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/brsdincer/orbitclassification

### Description of the Data

DATA FOR ORBIT CLASS PREDICTION
It is based on prediction process.
Data was generated without including of the unnecessary columns.

INLUCED:

* a (AU) -- Semi-major axis of the orbit in AU
* e -- Eccentricity of the orbit
* i (deg) -- Inclination of the orbit with respect to the ecliptic plane and the equinox of 
J2000 (J2000-Ecliptic) in degrees
* w (deg) -- Argument of perihelion (J2000-Ecliptic) in degrees
* Node (deg) -- Longitude of the ascending node (J2000-Ecliptic) in degrees
* M (deg) -- Mean anomoly at epoch in degrees
* q (AU) -- Perihelion distance of the orbit in AU
* Q (AU) -- Aphelion distance of the orbit in AU
* P (yr) -- Orbital period in Julian years
* H (mag) -- Absolute V-magnitude
* MOID (AU) -- Minimum orbit intersection distance (the minimum distance between the osculating orbits of the NEO and the Earth
class -- Object classification

CLASS:

* AMO*
* APO
* APO*
* ATE
* ATE*
* IEO*
